here I will chronicle the topics I want to learn and take notes on the same

At the same time I think it will help me practice gitHub so itÂ´s a win-win :) 

So I want to learn the basics first. That means finishing "Automate the boring stuff" (atbs) and getting through my video series.
I want to really crack down on one chapter a week and I will take the weekends to read the chapter.
Once I finish that I want to get into the first project for which I will write down my ideas in a separate document. 

The notes on the inidividual chapters will be in a separate file as well so I will get plenty of commit-practice.

After atbs I want to get into the ML learning path from Google.
